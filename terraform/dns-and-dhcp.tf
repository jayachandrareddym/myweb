# In this file, three things were accomplished: the private Route53 DNS zone was# created, the association with the VPC was made, and the DNS record for the
# database was created. Terraform perform the actions in the right order, 
#the last component in this file will be the database dns record because it
# depends on the private ip of the EC2 database machine. 
#This machine will be allocated during the database creation.
